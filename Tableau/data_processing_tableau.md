### List of data files and structures needed to complete the various Tableau stories/dashboards.

- [] district numbers running from 1 - 32 consistent across years --> This will be used to create indices for small multiples by district using this [link for small multiples](http://www.datablick.com/blog/2016/03/07/dynamic-small-multiples-in-tableau-by-chris-demartini)  
- [] data structured long that contains all the shocks, the deviations from national average by district, and the national averages by year, and changes within each district for each shock, confidence intervals would be nice too but maybe not necessary at this point  
- [] data structured long that contains the food consumption score variables, deviations from national average by distirct, and national averages by year
- [] Summary graphs of main coping strategies for major shock categories (raw.io or use local version on Mac)
- [] Create a filter variable for the districts in which FFP is most interested
